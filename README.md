# GoodbyeHtml 
A library for a one canvas based web page 
-----------------------------------------


With GoodbyeHtml you may easily create a full HTML page (or part(s) of it).
 
A great advantage of this approach is that the final result is 100% under your control on any browser and device.

The library is very careful about avoiding developer mistakes and about clear messaging the mistakes.


Warning: the library is still under construction.

Warning2: the source code must be packaged.
