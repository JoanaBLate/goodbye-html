# GoodbyeHtml 
A library for a one canvas based web page 
-----------------------------------------


With GoodbyeHtml you may easily create a full HTML page (or part(s) of it), using only one canvas.
 
A great advantage of this approach is that the final result is 100% under your control on any browser and device.

This system has good performance and consumes little memory.

The library is very careful about avoiding developer mistakes and about clearly messaging the mistakes.


Warning: the library is still under construction.

Warning2: the source code must be packaged.
