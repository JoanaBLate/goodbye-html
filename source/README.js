 *   This software creates canvas boxes, that you may use to produce a full HTML page (or part(s) of it).
 *
 *   A great advantage of this approach is that the final result is 100% under your control.
 *
 *   This code is (obviously) not compressed. It is up to you compress it or not.
 *
 *   This software tries to protect itself from the developer mistakes, throwing errors.
 *
 *   All args of any function are mandatory.
